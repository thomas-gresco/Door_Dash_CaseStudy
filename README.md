# DoorDash Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the DoorDash Data Analytics Project! In this module, we embarked on a real-world data analysis journey, honing our spreadsheet skills while delving into a modified version of a case study reminiscent of DoorDash's data analytics challenges. Let's take a closer look at our journey and the insights we've uncovered.

## Project Overview

As aspiring data analysts, we were tasked with analyzing data provided by DoorDash, a prominent player in the food delivery industry. Our objective was to derive valuable insights and propose data-driven actions to optimize marketing strategies and generate value for the company.

## Insights Uncovered

Throughout our project, we uncovered several key insights:

### Customer Segmentation
By filtering the data to include only records related to campaign 6, we identified the specific customer segment targeted by this campaign. This segmentation allowed us to tailor our analysis and recommendations accordingly.

### Spending Behavior
Sorting customers based on their total spending revealed intriguing patterns in spending behavior. We identified top spenders and gained valuable insights into their preferences and purchasing habits.

### Marketing Effectiveness
Utilizing pivot tables, we dissected the effectiveness of campaign 6 by analyzing the number of customers who bought during the campaign, broken down by age. This analysis provided actionable insights for refining future marketing strategies.

### Financial Impact
Calculating the total amount spent by customers and their average spending per transaction allowed us to quantify the financial impact of the campaign. These insights are invaluable for assessing ROI and optimizing marketing budgets.

### Customer Demographics
By creating age group categories and visualizing customer acquisition trends over time, we gained a deeper understanding of DoorDash's customer demographics and acquisition patterns.

## Next Steps

Armed with these insights, we are well-equipped to propose data-driven actions to optimize marketing campaigns and drive value for DoorDash. Our next steps may include:

- Refining marketing strategies based on customer segmentation and spending behavior.
- Tailoring promotional offers to target specific customer segments identified through our analysis.
- Continuously monitoring and analyzing customer demographics and acquisition trends to refine marketing efforts.

## Conclusion

The DoorDash Data Analytics Project has provided us with invaluable hands-on experience in data analysis and spreadsheet skills. By navigating through real-world challenges and uncovering actionable insights, we have honed our abilities to drive value through data-driven decision-making. As we continue our journey, let's apply these learnings to tackle new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the world of data analytics.
